# The barrel library

The swept barrel (the Padang Padang spec, Part B) draws its tube from 2D overturn profiles simulated in Navier–Stokes. They are swept along the breaking front, each slice at its own clock (τ, from the throw). This note covers the library's cases, how they check against the published fits and the field, what they cost, and how to add one. The per-case table is generated: [barrel-cases.md](barrel-cases.md).

Tags: **[measured]** in the model, or in the lab or field where said; **[modelled]** from a published simulation or fit; **[inferred]** my reasoning.

## The cases

Four runs of the advisor's Basilisk setup (`tools/basilisk`, GPL-3.0, run apart from the game) on round 6's Padang Padang transect, up a 1:19 slope along the wave's path to a reef flat 1.25 m deep (0.179 h0), at level 12. The game blends them by H0/h0, the crest at the wedge's 7 m foot over the depth there:
- three solitary waves of height A0·h0 at the foot;
- the Small swell's case, below the solitaries' range: the second crest of a 16 s cnoidal train (H/h0 0.195), its crest at the foot 0.99 m, so A0 = 0.141.
  - The advisor ran and analysed it (2026-09-30; `periodic_library.py`, times by `plunge_measure.py` with the local trough as the water level and a crest window past the backwash's steps).
  - Swell breaks on the wedge where a soliton that small would run on to the flat, so a periodic run stands for Small (the advisor).
  - It is built with `--a0 periodic_padang19s_L12=0.1414`, since its own A0 is the train's height.

| Case | H0/h0 | Where it overturns | H_I at h0 = 7 m | Void L × W just before touchdown | Open tube, vertical to touchdown | Frames | Asset |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pad19-a20-l12` | 0.2 | on the reef flat, about 1 h0 past its edge | 1.97 m | 0.90 × 0.45 m | 0.59 s | 145 | 145 KB |
| `pad19-a30-l12` | 0.3 (the owner's case) | at the reef flat's edge | 2.58 m | 2.11 × 1.00 m | 1.00 s | 158 | 158 KB |
| `pad19-a45-l12` | 0.45 | on the wedge, about 2.6 h0 before the flat | 3.67 m | 3.34 × 1.45 m | 1.16 s | 163 | 163 KB |
| `periodic-padang19s-l12` | 0.141 (the Small swell's crest) | on the wedge, 14 m before the flat, in 1.99 m | 2.24 m over the trough ahead | 0.86 × 0.39 m | 0.82 s | 176 | 176 KB |

All [measured] in the model. Each case holds 128 points per frame, in h0, from 2.7–2.9 √(h0/g) before its face goes vertical (the clock's earliest frame, −3, clamps to the first) to one frame past touchdown, in the `BRL1` form (`src/wave/barrel/profileFormat.ts`), and loads from `public/barrels/` through `src/wave/barrel/barrelLibraryIndex.ts`.

## Validation

Each case at its last output before touchdown, against Pick & Feddersen's fits in ψ0 = s/(H0/h0)^¼ [modelled], within round 2's tolerances (areas ±0.05, W/L ±0.1, θ ±5°), and against Mead & Black's field survey [measured, field]:

- **The tube's shape matches.** W/L is 0.50, 0.47 and 0.44 against the fits' 0.43, 0.42 and 0.40, all inside. L/W is 2.01, 2.11 and 2.30: the two smaller cases fall inside Padang Padang's own 1.97–2.14, the largest inside the reefs' 1.42–3.43.
- **The tube's size is smaller than the fits'.** A_O/H_I² is 0.05, 0.19 and 0.23 against the fits' 0.38, 0.34 and 0.30. The fits are for plane slopes, where a smaller wave's larger ψ0 gives the rounder tube. On this wedge the tube grows with the wave instead, and a small wave makes a small, steep tube:
  - A0 0.2 overturns over the flat and barely curls.
  - The advisor's periodic 14 s wave (1.22 m foot crest, level 12) broke on the wedge 15 m before the flat, and still made a tube of about 0.04 H² at about 70° [measured, NS].
  - The library's own Small-swell case (16 s, 0.99 m at the foot) went vertical 14 m before the flat. Just before touchdown its tube is 0.035 H² over the trough ahead, W/L 0.45 (fit 0.44, inside), L/W 2.20 and tilt 39°, inside Padang Padang's 29–41° [measured, NS]. Its lip spans only 4.1 cells, under the 6 the grid rule asks for, so its areas may read slightly high; the advisor can rerun its fine phase at level 13.
  - So small tubes are what small waves do here, not only the flat folding a solitary wave [inferred]. The periodic and solitary shapes at Padang agree within about ×2 in area and a few degrees in tilt, so the solitary library serves for the shapes; the periodic runs mattered for timing (the advisor).
  - The direction matches Blenkinsopp & Chaplin's flume reef, a 1:10 wedge dropping to deeper water, where breaking intensified as the crest's submergence fell (their abstract).
  - Pick & Feddersen (2026, §4.1) restate that reef's A_O/H² as 0.05–0.35, rising with H0/h_c, and O'Dea et al.'s field A_O/H² as 0.05–0.3. The three cases sit inside both. Those ranges are as restated; neither original paper was opened [not opened].
  - No plane-slope case was run to show the fits hold here otherwise.
- **The jet.** A_J/H_I² is 0.11, 0.21 and 0.18 against 0.20, 0.17 and 0.14. The larger two are inside the tolerance.
- **The tilt.** θ_O is 57°, 41° and 40° against 31°, 35° and 39°. Only the largest case is inside, but the two larger are inside Padang Padang's 29–41° [measured, field].

**The level-12 impact frame.** `metrics.py` measures at the last overturned frame whose jet stands at least 3 cells off the face. At level 12, the frame before touchdown can hold the jet 2 cells off, and there the landmarks took a sliver for the void: A0 0.3 read 0.001 H_I², against a steady 0.19 over the 0.3 s before.

## Cost

- **Wall time** [measured]: 265, 282 and 298 min for A0 0.2, 0.3 and 0.45. Each ran on one core of the M1 Air, all three at once while the game's probes ran beside them.
- **Analysis:** `analyse` needs Python with numpy, scipy and matplotlib. It takes a few minutes per run.
- **Size in the game:** 145–176 KB per case, 642 KB for the four. They load once, when the spot does.

## Landmark cleanliness

Frames whose landmark checks passed, by phase [measured]:

| Case | Before the face is vertical | Open tube | After touchdown |
|---|---|---|---|
| A0 0.2 | 116 / 117 | 27 / 27 | 48 / 117 |
| A0 0.3 | 106 / 110 | 47 / 47 | 42 / 104 |
| A0 0.45 | 98 / 108 | 54 / 54 | 49 / 99 |
| Small swell (periodic) | 127 / 136 | 39 / 39 | 61 / 226 |

- Every open-tube frame is clean.
- Before the face goes vertical, the only flags are the lip landmark jumping (1, 4, 10 and 9 frames). Those frames are refilled linearly from their clean neighbours.
- After touchdown, the splash-up tears the surface inside the window. A case keeps only one frame past touchdown, so the torn frames never reach the game.

## The level-13 comparison

The owner's level-13 run of A0 0.3 on the M4 Pro (`run_padang.sh` at its defaults) will show whether level 12 has converged. Until it lands, the level-12 values above are provisional.

## Adding a case

1. Scout the case's window at level 10, as in `tools/basilisk/README.md`: set `LEVEL=10` and the amplitude, then find when the lip folds over and touches down.
2. Run it at level 12 with `TOUT0` about 3 s before the fold and `TMAX` 3 s past touchdown. For example: `LEVEL=12 A0=0.3 TOUT0=18.5 TMAX=25 NAME=pad19_a30_L12 tools/basilisk/run_padang.sh`.
3. Analyse it with the same variables and `analyse`.
4. Rebuild the whole library, naming every run each time. The index lists exactly the runs named. For example: `npm run barrels -- --run pad19_a20_L12 --run pad19_a30_L12 --run pad19_a45_L12 --run periodic_padang19s_L12 --a0 periodic_padang19s_L12=0.1414 --flat 0.1785714`.
   - The flat is the reef flat's depth in h0.
   - A periodic run's `--a0` is its crest at the foot over h0, and its metrics are read in `plunge_measure.py`'s form.
   - The advisor's periodic files live on their branch, under `docs/research/water-physics/notes/round6-tube-profiles/data/`; copy them into the runs directory.
5. Commit `public/barrels/*.bin`, the index and `barrel-cases.md`. Record the run in the README's table.

## The front's join and throw

Where each slice's clock starts and when its lip throws (Part B, PR 2; `src/wave/barrel/sliceClock.ts`):

- **The join** is where the game's solver first breaks swell of that size, fresh. The `periodicOnset` probe drove regular waves up one column of the transect, at 14, 16, 17 and 18 s. A crest joins by its highest over the 6–5 m band of still depth, at 2.3–4.6 m [measured in the model].
- **The throw** is where the Navier–Stokes wave's face goes vertical: d = 1.56 + 0.56 η_foot at h0 = 7 m, clamped to foot crests of 0.99–2.50 m and scaled by h0/7 for the tide. It comes from the advisor's periodic Basilisk runs at level 12: 0.99 m → 1.99 m (16 s, the Small case), 1.22 m → 2.45 m (14 s), 1.65 m → 2.38 m (16 s) and 2.50 m → 2.97 m (18 s), residuals within 0.21 m [measured, NS]. The line through them is [inferred]: the runs confound height with period, and period dependence is untested.
- **Why the throw is not a lag after the join.** Kennedy's onset leads a soliton's vertical face by 2.3–2.8 √(h0/g) (`kennedyLag` probe) [measured]. For swell, the three periodic runs read 0.22, 2.30 and 1.60, no function of depth. So a crest joins only if the solver breaks it before it reaches its throw depth.
- **The cost** is 6.0 ms per frame against a 529 ms step, 1.1 %, on Padang Padang's Small swell at 1 m cells (320 × 574) with 203 front points on average. That was on the M1 Air while the three Basilisk runs shared it; the ratio is the number to keep [measured].

## The loft

The swept barrel as drawn (Part B, PR 3; `src/wave/barrel/sweptLoft.ts`). The `padangLoft` probe ran Padang Padang's Small swell (Hs 1.2 m, 16 s) at 1 m cells for 180 s of sea, lofting every front every step over the Classic look's heights [measured]:

- **Cost.** 0.89 ms a frame against the step's 158.8 ms, 0.6 %, in Node on the M1 Air. Up to 39,664 vertices at once, for a 140 m front: the budget was reached at the biggest sets, with 4–15 clock steps clamped then.
- **The open curl** ran 3–9 m along the crest at the median, up to 13 m, against the checklist's 3–10 m.
- **Neighbouring clocks** differed by 1.4–2.8 library frames at the median, 2–3.8 at the 90th percentile, within the 3-frame stage.
  - Spikes of 10–20 frames came now and then, most likely where a front's newest points join beside thrown ones [inferred].
  - The refinement halves such a step but cannot close it, so it stays a tooth until PR 2's fit covers the joining point.
- **The anchored crest against the solver's crest**, over open slices:
  - 0.3–1.0 m at the median and 0.6–2.5 m at the 90th percentile;
  - 928 of 17,082 open slices (5.4 %) sat over 2 m off, the most 4.8 m.

  The advisor asked to hear past about 2 m. The profile throws where the Navier–Stokes wave goes vertical and runs forward as the library's lip does, while the solver's crest moves on its own after it breaks.
- **Every lookup was clamped on this swell** while the library held only the solitaries: its foot crests (A0 about 0.14) stood under the smallest case (0.2), so they scaled that case by their own foot crest, as ruled. The Small swell's own periodic case (A0 0.141, above) now covers them.
- **Slices after touchdown** stay on the front while the solver's bore breaks on. Lofted at zero weight, invisible and unmasked, they filled the budget at the big sets.

The advisor's follow-ups (2026-09-30), rerun on the same sea [measured]:
- **Faded slices are dropped** from the loft and its budget. The loft fell to 0.50 ms a frame, 0.3 % of the step. The most vertices at once was 15,544, and no clock was clamped.
- **The drawn crest's distance from the solver's is soft-capped:** its own up to 1.5 m, then 1.5 + x/(1 + x) with x the excess in metres, so at most 2.5 m. That is the rational twin of the advisor's tanh, since the loft stays + − × ÷ √.
  - 1,809 of 17,773 open slices were capped. Their median life was 0.76 of the open time.
  - By fifths of the open time they fell 78 / 124 / 309 / 505 / 793, so 44 % in the last fifth.
- **So the anchor starts back to the solver's crest at 80 % of the open time,** over the 0.3 s handover, where the lip collapses and the crest landmark is least defined (the advisor's rule).
